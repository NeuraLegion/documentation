# CI Pipeline Integration
You can initiate a Nexploit scan on every new build in your application or API directly from your CI pipeline. The integration allows you to simplify the security testing process without leaving your development environment. You can configure the Nexploit integration with the following CI pipelines: 
* [GitHub Actions](guide/pipeline-integration/pipe-management/github-actions.md)
* [CicleCI](guide/pipeline-integration/pipe-management/circleci.md)
* [Jenkins](guide/pipeline-integration/pipe-management/jenkins/use-cases.md)
* [Azure Pipelines](guide/pipeline-integration/pipe-management/azure-devops.md)
* [Travis CI](guide/pipeline-integration/pipe-management/travis/use-cases.md)
* [JFrog](guide/pipeline-integration/pipe-management/jfrog.md)
* [GitLab](guide/pipeline-integration/pipe-management/gitlab/use-cases.md)
