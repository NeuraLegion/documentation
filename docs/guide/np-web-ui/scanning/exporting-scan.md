# Exporting a Scan 

You can download the scan report in the PDG, JSON or CSV format for further proceeding. Nexploit provides you with the oppotunity to select the scope of the information to be included into the PDF report. For example, you can get a full report or only select the certain parts of the full report to be exported.

The following PDF report options are available:
* **Full Report** – Combines the **Executive Summary** and the **Scan Details** reports.
* **Executive Summary** – Is intended for executives. It contains a brief analysis of each issue and its possible consequences, as well as a compliance report.
* **Scan Details** – Provides detailed information about the scan, including all the technical information about the issues that have been detected, possible consequences, remedy suggestions, and much more.
* **Custom report** – Enables you to select the parts of the full report to be exported during this action.
