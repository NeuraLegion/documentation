# Retesting a Scan
Retesting at issue creates a separate scan entity that is a duplicate of the selected scan. Initially, the settings are identical, but you can mofify them without affecting the original scan settings. A separate [scan history](guide/np-web-ui/scanning/reviewing-scan-history.md) is maintained for each retested scan.

To retest an existing scan, follow these steps:
1. In the left pane, select the **Scans** option to display the scans List. 
2. Click ![Dots](media/dots-button.png ':size=2%') next to the scan to be retested.
3. From the drop-down list, select **Retest**.

    ![retest-scan](media/retest-scan.png ':size=60%')

4. In the **RETEST SCAN** dialog box, check and, if necessary, modify the scan settings, and then click **Retest scan**.<br>
    Depending on the settings, the scan will be run immediately or will be scheduled for later.
