# Managing Your Plan
Subscription plans represent different price options for predefined packages of scan services.  You can study the Nexploit standard plans or make a request for a customized one on [our website](https://www.neuralegion.com/pricing/).

You can check the current plan details, payment information and history in the relative sections on the **Accounting and Billing** page. 

### Upgrade a Plan 
If the current plan capabilities do not meet your scanning needs, you can upgrade the plan by following these steps:
1. In the upper-right corner of the **Accounting and Billing** page, click **Change Plan**.
2. From the available plans table, select the plan which better fits your requirements.
   Currently only Pro Plan and Enterprise Plan are available.

3. Do the following:
   * _For Pro Plan_. Click **Subscribe** and proceed to the checkout.
   * _For Enterprise Plan_.  Click **Contact** to fill in the request form on our website. 

   All payment events (even if you subscribe to Free plan or a trial period where the price is $0.00) are displayed in the PAYMENT HISTORY table.  Creating a payment event takes some time, so you may need to reload the page or wait until the relative history record appears.


### Unsubscribe from a Plan 

To unsubscribe from the current plan, follow these steps:
1. On the **Upgrade your plan** page, click **UNSUBSCRIBE** in the column with the current plan, and then confirm the action on the popup.
2. The plan prolongation will be disabled, but the subscription itself will be cancelled at the end of the billing period.
   If you unsubscribe from the plan before the prepaid period ends, the plan service is still available until this period expires. After the prepared subscription ends, you will be moved back to our free plan, and your credit card will no longer be charged.
