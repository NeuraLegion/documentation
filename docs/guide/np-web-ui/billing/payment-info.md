# Managing Payment Information
To pay for the selected plan, you need to provide the billing information and add a valid payment card.

Currently Nexploit does not support 16-digit Diners Club cards (14-digit cards are acceptable).
 
### Add Billing Details
 
To add the billing information, complete the fields in the **Billing Details** tab of the **PAYMENT INFO** section. The provided info will then be used during a further checkout procedure.

When the payment card expires, Nexploit cannot charge it in the next billing cycle, and the plan service might be discontinued. To avoid that, please make sure that the selected card provides a proper validity period.

### Select a Default Payment Method

To select a card to be used by default during upgrading the current plan, follow these steps:
1. In the **PAYMENT INFO** section, open the **Cards** tab.
2. From the **Default method** drop-down list, select the card to be used as default.
